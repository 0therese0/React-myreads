# MyReads Project

This is Project 6 in Udacity's Front End Nano Degree Program, created with React.  Users can add and remove books to each category or shelf by clicking add button '+' on the lower left of the main page.  Main page contains three shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read".  Users can categorize books to different shelves by click arrow down button on lower left of each book.

## Installation

To get started
* Clone/ download repository to your computer
* Navigate to project folder on your computer
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`
* Type `localhost:3000` on your choice of browser to view project, if none is opened after previous step.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
